GYM Fitness Portfolio

#Introduction

This repo contains my Gym portfolio. The portfolio has information about the gym and a contact page to the gym instructor. It was was created with HTML, bootstrap css and JavaScript. It is lightweight and fully responsive, as well as comes with the Bootstrap grid system and loaded with Font Awesome. The site is static and comes production ready if you just want to add your information and go.ly. The site was built as modular as possible to make it easy to shift around styles and content.
